Batch processing

Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts. 
An operating system does the following activities related to batch processing âˆ’
The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.
The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executes them without any manual information.
Jobs are processed in the order of submission, i.e., first come first served fashion.
When a job completes its execution, its memory is released and the output for the job gets copied into an output spool for later printing or processing

Advantages
Batch processing takes much of the work of the operator to the computer.
Increased performance as a new job get started as soon as the previous job is finished, without any manual intervention.

Disadvantages
Difficult to debug program.
A job could enter an infinite loop.
Due to lack of protection scheme, one batch job can affect pending jobs.
