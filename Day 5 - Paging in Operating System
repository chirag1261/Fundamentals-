Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. 
This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non â€“ contiguous.

    Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An address generated by the CPU
    Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space( represented in words or bytes): The set of all logical addresses generated by a program
    Physical Address (represented in bits): An address actually available on memory unit
    Physical Address Space (represented in words or bytes): The set of all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses
    
    Example:

    If Logical Address = 31 bit, then Logical Address Space = 231 words = 2 G words (1 G = 230)
    If Logical Address Space = 128 M words = 27 * 220 words, then Logical Address = log2 227 = 27 bits
    If Physical Address = 22 bit, then Physical Address Space = 222 words = 4 M words (1 M = 220)
    If Physical Address Space = 16 M words = 24 * 220 words, then Physical Address = log2 224 = 24 bits

The mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the memory management unit (MMU) which is a hardware device and this mapping is known as paging technique.

    The Physical Address Space is conceptually divided into a number of fixed-size blocks, called frames.
    The Logical address Space is also splitted into fixed-size blocks, called pages.
    Page Size = Frame Size
    
    Address generated by CPU is divided into

    Page number(p): Number of bits required to represent the pages in Logical Address Space or Page number
    Page offset(d): Number of bits required to represent particular word in a page or page size of Logical Address Space or word number of a page or page offset.

Physical Address is divided into

    Frame number(f): Number of bits required to represent the frame of Physical Address Space or Frame number.
    Frame offset(d): Number of bits required to represent particular word in a frame or frame size of Physical Address Space or word number of a frame or frame offset.
