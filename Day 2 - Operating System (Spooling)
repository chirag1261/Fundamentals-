Spooling - It is a kind of buffering mechanism or a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program or the system. 
Data is sent to and stored in memory or other volatile storage until the program or computer requests it for execution.

In a computer system peripheral equipments, such as printers and punch card readers, etc. 
They are very slow relative to the performance of the rest of the system. Getting input and output from the system was quickly seen to be a bottleneck. 
Here comes the need for spool.

Spooling works like a typical request queue where data, instructions and processes from multiple sources are accumulated for execution later on. Generally, 
It is maintained on computerâ€™s physical memory, buffers or the I/O device-specific interrupts. 
The spool is processed in FIFO manner i.e. whatever first instruction is there in the queue will be popped and executed.

Advantages of Spooling:-

Since there is no interaction of I/O devices with CPU, so the CPU need not wait for the I/O operation to take place. The I/O operations take a large amount of time.
The CPU is kept busy most of the time and hence it is not in the idle state which is good to have a situation.
More than one I/O devices can work simultaneously.
